All the tasks which was assingned by Bharat Intern for Data Science Intern are completed Succesfully

# TASK:1 ðŸ“ŠStock Market Prediction using LSTM

In this notebook, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We will learn how to use to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. We will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method.


# TASK:2 Titanic Classification Predication ðŸ“ˆ

Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers:

I will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. We will do some basic data analysis, then some visulaization on the dataset, and in the end-use some of the popular models for prediction.
